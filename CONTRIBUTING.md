# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome, no matter how large or small!

We want this community to be friendly and respectful to each other. Please follow it in all your interactions with the project. Before contributing, please read the [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Minimum Requirement

This project requires node 16 to run. You can check your current node version using the command `node -v`. If you are using another version, you can install nvm to run different node version across projects.

- Install nvm globally
  ```sh
  brew install nvm
  ```

- Install node version 16 using nvm
  ```sh
  nvm install v16
  ```

- To automatically switch node versions between projects, paste the following snippet in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file

  ```sh
  # place this after nvm initialization!
  autoload -U add-zsh-hook

  load-nvmrc() {
    local nvmrc_path
    nvmrc_path="$(nvm_find_nvmrc)"

    if [ -n "$nvmrc_path" ]; then
      local nvmrc_node_version
      nvmrc_node_version=$(nvm version "$(cat "${nvmrc_path}")")

      if [ "$nvmrc_node_version" = "N/A" ]; then
        nvm install
      elif [ "$nvmrc_node_version" != "$(nvm version)" ]; then
        nvm use
      fi
    elif [ -n "$(PWD=$OLDPWD nvm_find_nvmrc)" ] && [ "$(nvm version)" != "$(nvm version default)" ]; then
      echo "Reverting to nvm default version"
      nvm use default
    fi
  }

  add-zsh-hook chpwd load-nvmrc
  load-nvmrc
  ```

  After adding this, restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc` in your terminal.

Check [nvm official github](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for more information.

## Development workflow

To get started with the project, run `yarn` in the root directory to install the required dependencies for each package:

```sh
yarn
```

> While it's possible to use [`npm`](https://github.com/npm/cli), the tooling is built around [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/), so you'll have an easier time if you use `yarn` for development.

While developing, you can run the [example app](/example/) to test your changes. Any changes you make in your library's JavaScript code will be reflected in the example app without a rebuild. If you change any native code, then you'll need to rebuild the example app.

To start the packager:

```sh
yarn example start
```

To run the example app on Android:

```sh
yarn example android
```

To run the example app on iOS:

```sh
yarn example ios
```

Make sure your code passes TypeScript and ESLint. Run the following to verify:

```sh
yarn typecheck
yarn lint
```

To fix formatting errors, run the following:

```sh
yarn lint --fix
```

Remember to add tests for your change if possible. Run the unit tests by:

```sh
yarn test
```

To edit the Objective-C or Swift files, open `example/ios/HyperSdkReactExample.xcworkspace` in XCode and find the source files at `Pods > Development Pods > hyper-sdk-react`.

To edit the Java or Kotlin files, open `example/android` in Android studio and find the source files at `hyper-sdk-react` under `Android`.


### Commit message convention

We follow the [conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en) for our commit messages:

- `fix`: bug fixes, e.g. fix crash due to deprecated method.
- `feat`: new features, e.g. add new method to the module.
- `refactor`: code refactor, e.g. migrate from class components to hooks.
- `docs`: changes into documentation, e.g. add usage example for the module..
- `test`: adding or updating tests, e.g. add integration tests using detox.
- `chore`: tooling changes, e.g. change CI config.

Our pre-commit hooks verify that your commit message matches this format when committing.

### Linting and tests

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

We use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type checking, [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for linting and formatting the code, and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing.

Our pre-commit hooks verify that the linter and tests pass when committing.

### Publishing to npm

We use [release-it](https://github.com/release-it/release-it) to make it easier to publish new versions. It handles common tasks like bumping version based on semver, creating tags and releases etc.

To publish new versions, run the following:

```sh
yarn release
```

### Scripts

The `package.json` file contains various scripts for common tasks:

- `yarn bootstrap`: setup project by installing all dependencies and pods.
- `yarn typecheck`: type-check files with TypeScript.
- `yarn lint`: lint files with ESLint.
- `yarn test`: run unit tests with Jest.
- `yarn example start`: start the Metro server for the example app.
- `yarn example android`: run the example app on Android.
- `yarn example ios`: run the example app on iOS.

### Base test setup

To setup example project, setup merchant and customer details:
- navigate to [example->src->merchant_config.json](./example/src/merchant_config.json) and update below values:

```json
{
  "merchantId": "",
  "clientId": "",
  "apiKey": "",
  "privateKey": "",
  "merchantKeyId": ""
}
```
- navigate to [example->src->customer_config.json](./example/src/customer_config.json) and update below values:

```json
{
  "customerId": "",
  "mobile": "",
  "email": "",
  "amount": ""
}
```

### Sending a pull request

> **Working on your first pull request?** You can learn how from this _free_ series: [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://app.egghead.io/playlists/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

When you're sending a pull request:

- Prefer small pull requests focused on one change.
- Verify that linters and tests are passing.
- Review the documentation to make sure it looks good.
- Follow the pull request template when opening a pull request.
- For pull requests that change the API or implementation, discuss with maintainers first by opening an issue.
